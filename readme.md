# PROJECT 

This is running using a docker container, which is all set up. All you need to run for dev work is:
` docker-compose up -d `
 
** note: it's probably already running unless you did ` docker-compose down`

(to see you can type docker ps but whatevs)

then just navigate to localhost:8000 and do yer stuff
